ReTrack
=======
This project aims to integrate bug tracking into ReSharper.

The tentative roadmap is as follows:

* Present issues and comments
* Allow search within standalone app
* Allow search via an appropriate window in ReSharper

Issues are tracked, of course, in [YouTrack](http://retrack.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues).
